    <!-- Clevr Tenant ID -->   
    <!-- 
        In MySchoolSask, Clevr Tenant ID is stored in a field specific to each SCHOOL.
        To edit this value, change the "Clevr Tenant ID" for your school, which can be found in the following locations:
        - In School View -> School top-tab -> Setup side-tab -> Details leaf
        - In Division View -> Division top-tab -> Organizations side-tab -> Schools leaf -> Select the school you wish to edit

        This value MUST be present for a school's students to be included in the Clevr export. 
        Students at schools without this value present will be ignored by this export.
        If your entire division uses the same tenant ID, you will need to enter it for every school. 
        If your division has schools that don't use clevr, don't enter a tenant ID and those schools will be ignored.

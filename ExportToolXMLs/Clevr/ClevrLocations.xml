    NOTES:
    Clevr expects the school "type" to be a 1 or a 2, but that's not possible with this file alone.
    Either comment it out below, replacing it with the "blank" line directly above it, or use a 
    script to conver the string value to a 1 or 2.

<export table-id="tblSchool" header-row="true" value-delimiter="&#09;">

    <!-- Only load locations who are "Active" -->
    <filter field="sklInactiveInd" operator="equals" source="default" value="false" /> 

    <!-- Ignore schools with no tenant ID set -->    
    <filter field="sklFieldA008" operator="notEmpty" source="default" />

    <!-- Clevr Tenant ID -->   
    <!-- 
        In MySchoolSask, Clevr Tenant ID is stored in a field specific to each SCHOOL.
        To edit this value, change the "Clevr Tenant ID" for your school, which can be found in the following locations:
        - In School View -> School top-tab -> Setup side-tab -> Details leaf
        - In Division View -> Division top-tab -> Organizations side-tab -> Schools leaf -> Select the school you wish to edit

        This value MUST be present for a school's students to be included in the Clevr export. 
        Students at schools without this value present will be ignored by this export.
        If your entire division uses the same tenant ID, you will need to enter it for every school. 
        If your division has schools that don't use clevr, don't enter a tenant ID and those schools will be ignored.

    <!-- 
        School type (optional)
            Expected values:
                1 = elementary
                2 = secondary

        Pulling the "sklSchoolLevel" field will give you a string.
        You will need to convert this to a number externally.
